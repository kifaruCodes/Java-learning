## About this project
---
This is a learning project to practice the beginner concepts of Java that I have learnt so far.

I follow a tutorial from youtube by [Rakshith Vasudev](https://www.youtube.com/@RakshithVasudev), which you can view [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0X00EoFQbE&list=PLXuLP_lLi2eBoYWqukzSuevdKxyFu-ZiT&index=22&ab_channel=RakshithVasudev)

## System structure:
---
The project is a system managing students, teachers and money/funds.

This project explores basic OOP concepts and is not an exhaustive system with all bells and whistles. There is no GUI/front-end system, and most of the sections are hard-coded.

Below is an overview of the system flow.
